. Description:

        Version 0.1.4.

        CGI::Test has changed ownership. The new owner is Steven Hilton
        <mshiltonj@mshiltonj.com>.  Many thanks to Raphael Manfredi
        and Steve Fink.

        CGI::Test is now hosted as a SourceForge project. It is located 
        at <http://cgi-test.sourceforge.net>.

        POD updated to reflect the above.

        make() method on various objects has been deprecated, and has been
        replaced by more conventional (for me, at least) new() method. 
        Support for make() may be removed in a later release.

        Entire codebase reformatted using perltidy
        Go to <http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/> to see how neat it is.

        Self-referential object variable name standardized to '$this'
        throughout code.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.3.

        Changed test 22 in t/browse.pl to perform explicit sorting
        of the month parameter string, so that the string comparison
        is reliable.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.2.

        Discard parameters when figuring out content-type, so that
        we build proper Page objects.

        Added note about possible parameters in content_type in
        the man page for CGI::Test::Page.

        Fixed t/parsing regression test so that it works even when there
        are parameters in the returned content-type field.

. Description:

        Version 0.1.1.

        Set PERL5LIB in child to mirror parent's @INC, so that the CGI
        program, if written in Perl, can get the same include path.

        Version 0.1.0.
        Initial public alpha relase.
